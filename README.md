# Microsoft Teams Ramp-up
This solution belongs to my [blog series](https://www.rickvanrousselt.com/topics/teams/) about Microsoft Teams development. 

#Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. [Setup ngrok](https://www.rickvanrousselt.com/teams-ramp-up-part-2/)
3. Depending on how far you want to take this there is a lot of setup required (Teams app, Bot app,...) I suggest just start reading the entire blogpost series and don't hesitate to log an issue or contact me directly if you have any questions.
